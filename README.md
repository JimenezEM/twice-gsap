# Twice GSAP Website
An animated single-page website built with React, Vite, and GSAP.
The project reimagines a tutorial-based layout and transforms it into a creative, lyric-driven experience inspired by the song Alcohol-Free by TWICE.
Instead of traditional informational content, the site uses selected lyrics from Alcohol-Free as textual elements, blending music, motion, and front-end experimentation.

## Project Overview
This website was originally developed as a practice project following a GSAP + React tutorial.
The structure and animations were then adapted and customized to serve a real use case: a creative alternative to a class presentation for a Korean language course.

## Key Features
- Smooth GSAP-powered animations and transitions
- Modular React component structure
- Built for experimentation and learning rather than production data display

## Tech Stack
React, Vite, JavaScript (ES6+), GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), CSS.

## Design & Customization
- Tutorial-based layout adapted into an original concept
- Content fully customized using song lyrics

## Project Context
This project was created as a front-end animation practice project. A creative academic aid for a Korean language class.
While the base structure originated from a learning resource, all content decisions, styling choices, and thematic direction were independently implemented.

## Notes
This project is not intended for commercial use.
The repository showcases learning progress, animation experimentation, and creative adaptation.
